**To:** [Senior Management / Department Heads]
**CC:** [QA Lead, Engineering Lead, Project Managers]
**Subject:** Introducing VF Bug Health Dashboard - Real-Time Bug Visibility for All Teams

---

Dear Team,

I am pleased to share a new tool that we have developed to improve visibility into the VZY UAT bug health status across all platforms.

**Introducing the VF Bug Health Dashboard**

A single, always-updated web page that shows the current bug status for every platform at a glance - no Jira login required.

**Dashboard Link:** https://sunilk9898.github.io/vf-bug-dashboard/

---

**What does it do?**

The dashboard provides a real-time view of all active bugs across our 9 platforms (Android, ATV, CMS Adaptor, CMS Dashboard, DishIT, iOS, LG_TV, Samsung TV, Web), broken down by status (Open, In Progress, Reopened, In Review, Issue Accepted, Parked).

**Key highlights:**

- Data syncs automatically from Jira every 30 minutes - no manual updates needed
- Accessible to anyone with the link - no Jira account or login required
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers
- Visual summary cards, bar charts, and a detailed platform-status table
- Zero cost - built on free infrastructure

---

**Who is this for?**

- **Leadership & Management** - Quick health check before meetings, no need to dig into Jira
- **QA Teams** - Monitor testing queue and reopened issues across platforms
- **Engineering Teams** - Track bug resolution progress per platform
- **Project Managers** - Sprint planning input and release readiness checks
- **Stakeholders** - Stay informed without needing Jira access

---

**How to use it?**

Simply open the link in your browser: https://sunilk9898.github.io/vf-bug-dashboard/

That's it. The dashboard loads with the latest data and auto-refreshes. You can also bookmark it for quick access.

---

**What problem does this solve?**

Previously, checking bug status required logging into Jira, navigating to the VZY project, running specific queries, and manually compiling data across platforms. This was time-consuming and the information was often outdated by the time it was shared.

With this dashboard, everyone has access to the same up-to-date view at any time, reducing the need for status update meetings and ad-hoc Jira queries.

---

We welcome your feedback as we continue to improve the tool. Planned enhancements include historical trend charts, priority breakdown views, and email alerts for critical bug thresholds.

Please feel free to share the dashboard link with anyone in the team who would benefit from it.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
VZY Engineering Team
